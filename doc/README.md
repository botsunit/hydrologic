### CORE ###

`duplicate`

`{merge, Function :: function()} | {merge, Module :: atom(), Function :: atom()`

`fanin | {fanin, 0} | {fanin, 1}`


### STDLIB ###

`console` (map)

`{console, [Format :: string()]}` (map)

`{match, [Regex :: string()]}` (reduce)

`{pad, [Direction :: left | right, Size :: integer(), Char :: integer()]} | {pad, [Size :: integer(), Char :: integer()]}` (map)

`{chop, [Size :: integer()]}` (map)

`odd` (reduce)

`even` (reduce)


### Create a worker ###

```

-spec worker(data()) -> {map, data()}
                        | data()
                        | {reduce, true | false}
                        | {return, data()}
                        | {error, term()}.

```


### Examples ###

[](http://yuml.me/diagram/scruffy;dir:LR/class/%2F%2F Cool Class Diagram, [a|X rem 2 == 0|b]->[b|X + 2], [a|X rem 2 == 0|b]->[X * 2], [X * 2]->[b|X + 2])

```

hydrologic:new(
  test,
  [
   {a, {fun(X) ->
            {reduce, X rem 2 == 0}
        end, b}},
   fun(X) ->
       {map, X * 2}
   end,
   {b, fun(X) ->
           {map, X + 2}
       end},
   return
  ]
 ),
hydrologic:run(test, 10), % => 22
hydrologic:run(test, 7). % => 9

```
